# Developing a Physician Performance Model in Critical Care: Assessing Quality and Value

## SSC Case Study - 2022

### Background
Patients in the ICU represent the most critical cases in the healthcare system, requiring intensive technologies and a collaborative healthcare team. This study aims to develop a comprehensive model for assessing physician performance in these challenging environments, considering multiple factors beyond traditional 360 evaluations.

### Physician Participants:
- **Evaluation Method:** 360 feedback evaluations by allied health professionals and peer physicians.
- **Feedback Domains:** Medical Expert, Communicator, Leader, Advocate, Professional, Scholar, and Collaborator.
- **Scoring:** 5-point Likert scale.
- **Characteristics:** Age, background medical discipline, leadership roles, rank.

### Patient Participants:
- **Data Collection:** Demographic, clinical, and administrative data at hospital discharge.
- **Standardization:** Uniform training, policies, equipment, and drug formulary across multisystem ICUs.
- **Environmental Variability:** Differences in working environments and patient profiles.

### Patient Status and Outcome Scores:
- **APACHE II:** ICU-specific acuity of illness score.
- **SOFA:** Sepsis-associated organ failure assessment score.

### Research Question:
How can we develop valid quality indicators to evaluate the performance of critical care physicians based on mock data sets, considering the complex interplay of medical expertise, team collaboration, and patient outcomes?

### Case Study Challenge:
- **Objective:** Develop indicators to assess physician performance in critical care.
- **Approaches:**
  - Examine variability in patient outcomes across ICU physicians.
  - Analyze the correlation between physician 360 evaluations and patient outcomes.
  - Study the impact of team culture on patient outcomes in different ICUs.
